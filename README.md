<h1>FiveM Roleplay</h1>
These scripts are rewritten from their original form and have been adjusted to fit roleplay servers as needed. There are different types of roleplay servers and some need different scripts from others. This scripts are the ones I used for my server and will work good for your server if you're trying to make your visitors happy, but at the same time you need to have a good staff team to moderate the usage of these scripts.

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Drag the Folders into your server's resources folder.</li>
  <li>Add the following code: <b>start FILENAME</b> under the other similar options. Example below.<br/>
