<h1>FiveM Roleplay - Death Script</h1>
  This script is more for strict/semi-strict roleplay servers. This script allows you to respawn/revive yourself without a limit, so if there if fail roleplay going on you can /revive and call a admin. You don't have to be dead to revive and you can do so even standing up this way you can reset your health easily. This is mainly meant to help servers take roleplay to an new hight and not make players wait 300 seconds to revive because then players will just leave your server unless they are dedicated.
